## Hi, I'm Liam.

Hi, I am a frontend developer based in Hanoi, Vietnam. I’m passionate about building smooth, intuitive user experiences that not only function well but also feel delightful to use. My focus lies in creating clean, maintainable interfaces and understanding the “why” behind user behavior to design with empathy and purpose.

For me, growth is not just about writing better code — it’s about becoming a better collaborator, listener, and learner. I believe every bug is a lesson, every project is a chance to grow, and every team brings a new perspective to learn from. In some projects, I’ve been a learner — absorbing new technologies, fresh ideas, and better practices from those around me. In others, I’ve taken on the role of a key contributor — helping shape architecture decisions, mentoring junior developers, and ensuring consistency across the frontend.

Whether I’m contributing code, asking questions, or supporting others, I value the spirit of collaboration. I believe in sharing what I know, staying curious, and building not just features — but trust and clarity across the team.

Outside of work, I enjoy quiet, reflective moments with a good book, a thoughtful podcast, or a cup of tea. I find inspiration in the slow things — deep conversations, long walks, and meaningful stories — all of which help me return to work with fresh ideas and a clear mind.
